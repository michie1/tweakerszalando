Py-notify is a Python package providing tools for implementing `Observer programming
pattern`_.  These tools include signals, conditions and variables.

Signals are lists of handlers that are called when signal is emitted. Conditions are
basically boolean variables coupled with a signal that is emitted when condition state
changes. They can be combined using standard logical operators (*not*, *and*, etc.) into
compound conditions. Variables, unlike conditions, can hold any Python object, not just
booleans, but they cannot be combined.
